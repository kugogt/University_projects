# 🏡 House Price Prediction – Machine Learning Pipeline in KNIME

This project addresses a **supervised machine learning** task: predicting house prices using the  
**"House Sales in King County, USA"** dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/harlfoxem/housesalesprediction).  

The entire workflow was developed in **KNIME**, and the repository includes **images of the pipeline**.  
*The KNIME file is available upon request.*

### Workflow Overview

The pipeline is structured into several stages, each handling a key aspect of the machine learning process:

#### Feature Engineering
- Creation of new variables (e.g., house age, volume of the house)
- Handling and removal of extreme values and outliers

#### Variable Transformation
- Log transformation of skewed numerical features
- Target encoding of the **ZIP code** variable based on average house prices

#### Feature Selection
- A **Random Forest–based** feature selection for non-linear models  
- A dedicated **feature selection process** for Linear Regression

#### Model Training
Multiple models were trained and compared:
- **Linear Regression** (with its own feature selection strategy)
- **Random Forest**
- **Gradient Boosting** <-- *Best model with MAE = $66,549 on test set*
- **Polynomial Regression**
- **Neural Network** (trained with **Rprop** optimizer)

Each model is highlighted within **yellow blocks** in the KNIME workflow.

### Experimental Comparison: Linear Regression Variants

To understand the individual impact of preprocessing steps, we ran multiple versions of **Linear Regression** as a fast and interpretable baseline. These are visually separated using **red blocks** in the workflow:

- **No log transformation**
- **No log transformation + no feature engineering**
- **No log transformation + no feature engineering + no feature selection**

This analysis shows how each step contributes to the model’s predictive performance.
